sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: the test of the 5000 sorted list, sort1 was faster than sort3 overall and was slower than sort2 with really narrow margin.
random5000 and random50000, sort1 was the slowest sort algorithm. And with a list of 50000 sorted numbers,
sort1 was slower than sort2 and faster than sort3. Given that bubble sort lower bound is omega n, more
