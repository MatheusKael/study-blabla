sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: the test of the 5000 sorted list, sort1 was faster than sort3 overall and was slower than sort2 with really narrow margin.
random5000 and random50000, sort1 was the slowest sort algorithm. And with a list of 50000 sorted numbers,
sort1 was slower than sort2 and faster than sort3. Given that the lower bound of the bubble sort is omega n,
then the larger the sorted list, the faster this algorithm will be compared to others


sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: sort2 was the faster of than all.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: At the random5000 and
