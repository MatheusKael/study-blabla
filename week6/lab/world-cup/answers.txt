Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The team with most chance of winning varies with low number of simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 10.000 simulations the predictions don't fluctuate too much
